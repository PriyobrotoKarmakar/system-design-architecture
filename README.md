# 🏗️ System Design Architecture

Welcome to **System Design Architecture** — a curated collection of my system design explorations, covering everything from **Low-Level Design (LLD)** to **High-Level Architecture (HLD)**.

This repository includes:
- 💻 **Code Implementations** — real-world design patterns and modular LLD examples  
- 🧠 **Architecture Blueprints** — visual HLD diagrams for scalable systems  
- 📄 **Design Notes** — reasoning, trade-offs, and scalability considerations  
- 🧰 **Tools & Technologies** — design stack and resources I use

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyobrotoKarmakar/system-design-architecture
```

Navigate into it:
```bash
cd system-design-architecture
```

## 🧭 Purpose

This repository documents my learning and practice journey through **System Design**.  
Each project demonstrates the evolution from concept → design → architecture → implementation.

Whether you’re preparing for interviews or building scalable systems, these designs aim to serve as a reference and inspiration.
